Auth
session based stateful
token based stateless

for token based we use JSON web token JWT

JWT
- Open standard that defines a selft-contained way of securely transmitting information
  between parties as a JSON object
- This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed

Adv
    - Stateless -> no additional storage
    - Can be easily shared among services
Consitis of three parts seperated by dots (.)
    * Header
    * Payload
    * Signature

#Header
 - Type of token, which is JWT
 - Singning algorithm -> (HMAC, SHA256, RSA)
#Payload
Contains the claim. Claims are statement about an entity and additional data
    Types of Claims
        - Registered: predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended (issuser, experation time)
        - Public: defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry
        - Private: these are the custom claims created to share information
#Signature
    To create the signature part you have t take the encoded header, the encoded payload,
    a secret, the algorithm specified in the header
